## Description
A decentralized application for auctioning items on the Ethereum blockchain. Features of the dapp include the following:

* Setting a *start price* and *end price* of an item.
* Specify the duration of the auction (in minutes.)
* Immediately withdraw funds after the auction has ended.
* Users bidding over the buy price are refunded the difference.


## Prerequisites
To run and interact with the dapp, you'll need to install the dependencies below. Click on the links for further instructions.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - requires the npm package manager that comes with Node.js.
- [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) - tool for deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.
- [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/) - to run a personal Ethereum blockchain.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via a web browser.


## Running the Dapp

#### 1. Open Ganache
To run a local Ethereum blockchain, launch Ganache with the default rpc address <http://127.0.0.1:7545>.

- Mac: open ganache from the applications directory.
- Windows: open either **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**, enter `cd ganache` and then `npm start`

#### 2. Clone, install and deploy
Open up a new terminal or shell window and then clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/takJohn/decentralized-auction.git
```
Change to the directory of the cloned repository and install the required packages.
```
$ cd decentralized-auction
$ npm install
```
Deploy the smart contract onto the local Ethereum blockchain.
```
$ truffle migrate
```
Run the light-server to view the application inside a browser.
```
$ npm run dev
```
This should open up your browser and automatically direct it to <http://localhost:3000/> - if it doesn't then just fire up your browser and type in the address manually. The browser should now be displaying the *loading* page. To view the auction interface, you'll need to log into your MetaMask account and refresh the page.

#### 3. Using MetaMask
Make sure the MetaMask plugin is enabled first before following these steps.

1. Click on the **MetaMask** icon.
2. Select **Restore from seed phrase** .
3. Copy the mnemonic from Ganache and paste it into the **Wallet Seed** box.
4. Enter a password and click **OK**.
5. Click on the **Main Network** menu and select **Custom RPC**.
6. Enter `http://127.0.0.1:7545` as the *New RPC URL* and then click **Save**.

To use the auction, you'll want to setup a few more accounts - on the **Accounts** page you can click on the *switch accounts* icon at the top to import more accounts. Click on **Import Account** and paste in more private keys from various addresses generated by Ganache.

## Using the Dapp
You can change the details of the auction by modifying the parameters inside **migration/2_deploy_contracts.js** (*see comments in the code for more information*). 

When the dapp is launched, your web browser will open a page that displays content relevant to the current active user.

### Admin (seller)
By default the first address listed in Ganache is the owner of the contract and therefore has admin rights.
* By clicking on any of the buttons on the auction page, you'll trigger the MetaMask pop-up to appear. Click on **Submit** to confirm the details of the transaction.
* You can cancel the auction whilst the auction is in progress. This allows all bidders to withdraw their funds.
* Providing there were bidders during the auction then the **Withdraw** button becomes available once the auction is over.
* The auction ends when the buy price has been met or when the **End Auction** button has been clicked. 
* Unfortunately you'll need to click on the **End Auction** button when the time limit has been reached (*see Future Improvements at the bottom of this page*).

### User (bidder)
Accounts not belonging to the contract owner can interact with the dapp as a standard user meaning you'll be able to bid for the item.
* By clicking on any of the buttons on the auction page, you'll trigger the MetaMask pop-up to appear. Click on **Submit** to confirm the details of the transaction.
* When you make a bid, your funds becomes locked into the contract and can only be unlocked when another bidder outbids you.
* The **Withdraw** button becomes available when you have funds to withdraw. This can happen if you placed a bid that's higher than the buying price or if someone else outbids you.

## Troubleshooting

These are just some of the problems you may encounter when running the dapp.

#### Truffle migration error
```
Error: Attempting to run transaction which calls a contract function...
```
If you've ran `truffle migrate` before then you'll need to run `truffle migrate --reset` instead or delete the **json** files from the **build/contracts** directory.

#### MetaMask transaction error
```
Error: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce.
```
This is an issue with running on a private network and occurs when the blockchain is shutdown with MetaMask still connected to it. The easiest solution is to restart Ganache with a new mnemonic phrase and then reimport all the accounts before running the dapp again.

#### Missing MetaMask window
If a MetaMask transaction window doesn't appear when making a submission to the page then it's likely that a MetaMask pop-up already exists and needs to be closed first in order to proceed.

#### Page not updating
It should only take a few seconds when making any kind of submission on the page. Occasionally events will stop registering and the browser will become stuck or out of sync, unfortunately this is a known bug with MetaMask and you may have to restart Ganache as well as your browser.

## Testing
The test script **test/auction.js** contains a bidding scenario where multiple parties are bidding all the way up to the item finally being bought. To run the script, you need to open up a terminal or shell window and change to the directory **decentralized-auction** then execute `truffle test`

## Acknowledgements
* Using OpenZeppelin's [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/Math.sol) for a number of math operations.
* The auction contract is based on the [simple open auction](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html#simple-open-auction) example.

## Future Improvements
* Use [Ethereum Alarm Clock](http://www.ethereum-alarm-clock.com/) to automatically trigger fund withdrawals when the auction is over.
